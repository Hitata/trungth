## Docker
1. I took a few days reading about docker
- docker container, docker image, docker api, docker cli
- dockerfile to setup a new custom container
- docker composer to setup a project with multiple container and have association with each other.
- docker composer github repo of frontend backend setup, with react and rails api

2. I'm starting with setting up docker project from scratch
- Write a dockerfile! 

## Dockerfile [a really good tutorial](http://jdlm.info/articles/2016/03/06/lessons-building-node-app-docker.html)
1. FROM Node:6.10.3 (Stable LTS)
- specify the version tag and not use the 'latest'.
2. Npm is included in Node:6 is npm:3.10.10
